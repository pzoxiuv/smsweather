SMS Weather, a service for delivering weather forecasts via text messages.

Text a forecast request to 412-423-8207.  Make requests in the form of a
location, desired number of forecasts, and forecast type.  Defaults to
a single full forecast.

Location can be either a zip code, or a city and a state.

Number of forecasts is how many forecast periods will be given.  For example,
requesting four forecasts at 11am on a Tuesday will return the forecasts for
"This afternoon," "Tonight," "Wednesday," and "Wednesday night."

Forecast type is either "short" or "full."  An example of a short forecast
might be "Partly cloudy" or "Chance thunderstorms."  A full forecast is longer,
e.g. "A chance of drizzle, then a chance of rain or drizzle after 1am.  Patchy
fog.  Otherwise, cloudy, with a low around 61. East wind around 7 mph.  Chance
of precipitation is 30%. New precipitation amounts between a tenth and quarter
of an inch possible."
